Hi! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Brian, a mechanical engineer
turned programmer. I'm a lifelong learner and love using
cool tech to solve challenging problems.

I grew up in a small town outside Kansas City, Missouri, and
lived in Phoenix, AZ for a while. I'm married and have two
kiddos and love to spend time with them. I studied mechanical
and nuclear engineering at Kansas State, and quickly after
graduating begin moving more and more into software.

I spent seven years working for a small software group within
a big engineering firm in Kansas City. Now I work as a
software engineer at BombBomb. I'm comfortable in all kinds
of languages, but my favorites are python, typescript,
and C#. While I have experience in modern front-end technologies
like Angular and React, my preference is typically on back-end
services, making them blazing fast and beautifully written.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my family.
My boys are 3 and 9mo, so they take up a lot of my time.
When I'm not spending time with my family, I'm watching
tv shows, playing video games, or working out.
